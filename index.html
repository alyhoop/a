    <h1>Removing Acne</h1>
    <h2>...wish I knew this a century ago</h2>
        <p>I've struggled with cystic acne since I was 13, <br>
        NOW at 24 I hope I can save someone else the embarrassment and
        experimentation I went through!<br><br><br><br>

        I'm just an everyday girl who wants to empower others! <br><br>

        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Differin-Adapalene-0-1-Acne-Treatment/dp/B07L1PHSY9"target="_blank">THE CURE!</a> <br><br>

        Above is just one example, but the cure is using a <i>retinoid</i><br>

        Today you can buy them <i>over the counter</i> at any supermarket. <br><br><br>

        Most importantly, use this religiously, <strong>not</strong> as a spot treatment,
        but as a thin mask over the area suffering from acne. <br><br><br>

        It will take about three months before you start seeing results and
        about six before the area is spotless and without scarring.
        <br> It was difficult to
        remain hopeful when countless other products failed me, but this <i>works.</i>

          <h3>Let's get to it already...</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Don't use immediately after washing - you'll burn your skin. Red snake? Ew!</li>
                <li>Use a dot the size of a thumbtack and spread to affected areas.</li>
                <li>Get a real night cream - body lotion clogs pores- I didn't think it mattered either.</li> <br>
                <p>Pond's brand is cheap and you'll thank me later. Create a lotion mask! Don't skimp. When you first
                begin using the retinoid, you'll have some serious skin irritation, so you'll
                want to hydrate your skin well to prevent #snakeface. I lived it.</p>
                <li>Apply religiously. Be serious about your GLOW UP!!!</li>
              < /ol>
