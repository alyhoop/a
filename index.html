    <h3><i>acne ... we've all been there</i></h3>

        <p>I've struggled with cystic acne since I was 13, NOW at 24 I hope I can save someone else the embarrassment and experimentation I went through!<br>
        I'm just an everyday girl who wants to empower others!
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Differin-Adapalene-0-1-Acne-Treatment/dp/B07L1PHSY9"target="_blank">This is what I use!</a> <br><br><br>
        Above is just one brand, but the cure is using a <strong>retinoid.</strong> You can buy them <strong>over the counter</strong> at Wal-Mart.

        <br>Use it religiously - <strong>not</strong> as a spot treatment -
        as thin mask over the area suffering from acne.<br>

        It will take ~ three months before you start seeing results and
        ~ six before the area is scarless.
        </p>

          <h3>let's get to it ...</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Apply once a day at night. Be serious about your GLOW UP!!!</li>
                <li>Don't use immediately after washing - you'll burn your skin. #preventsnakeface</li>
                <li>Use a dot the size of two thumbtack heads and apply to affected areas (like a mask, NOT spot treatment.)</li>
                <li>Get a real face night cream - body lotion clogs pores - I didn't think it mattered either. #preventsnakeface</li>
              </ul><br>
